The land yields around two tonnes  of rice per hectare. To supplement their income they also grow chillis. Part of their land will be cultivated twice a year when the government finishes building the irrigation system next year. This loan will be used to buy fertiliser and insecticide. <br /><a href=\"http://www.lendwithcare.org/entrepreneurs/index/3070\">Read Houch's story</a> and learn how you can help similar entrepreneurs</p><h2>Darwin Castillo Picoita, Ecuador, farming</h2><p>Darwin specialises in the production of greenhouse tomatoes and coffee. He relies on loans to help his farming - large investments are needed at particular times of the year when there may be weeks or even months until the harvest comes in. Darwin has asked for a loan to buy seeds, fertiliser and prepare the land for growing coffee. Most of the weeding and preparing of the coffee bushes has to be done by hand, so he often hires labourers. <br /><a href=\"http://www.lendwithcare.org/entrepreneurs/index/3080\">Read Darwin's story</a> and learn how you can help similar entrepreneurs</p><h2>Angélica María Tene Pintado, Ecuador, raising poultry</h2><p>Angélica is 23 and married with a three-year-old daughter. When she's not raising and selling chickens and guinea pigs on land next to her home, she studies Business Administration. She sells the chickens and guinea pigs directly to consumers because she can make more money that way. The loan would be used to buy chicks and feed in bulk, and make improvements to the animals' housing.<br /><a href=\"http://www.lendwithcare.org/entrepreneurs/index/2431\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read Angélica's story</a> and learn how you can help similar entrepreneurs</p><h2>Zejna Hibic, Bosnia-Herzegovina, farmer</h2><p>Zejna is 60 years old and makes her living as a farmer, growing and selling vegetables such as peas, potatoes and onions.

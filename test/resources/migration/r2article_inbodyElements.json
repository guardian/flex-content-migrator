      "bodyText": "<p><strong>1. </strong>Remarkable, isn't it, that old CD cases and video cassette tapes can be converted into colourful pencils and pens?  The <a href=\"http://www.remarkableoffice.co.uk\">Remarkable Office</a> specializes in high-quality office supplies made from recycled materials. Pens, pencils, rulers and pencil cases are available in quantities suitable for back-to-school shopping.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Want to play kick-about in the playground with a ball that isn't made by child labour? Well, it's now possible to buy Fairtrade sports balls.  Certified balls are available at Oxfam shops, Blackwell's bookshops and online at <a href=\"http://www.fairdealtrading.com\">fairdealtrading.com</a>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>A women's co-operative in the Philippines manufactures this handsome Fairtrade rucksack and pencil case out of old juice boxes.  The rucksack can be purchased at Amnesty International's <a href=\"http://www.amnestyshop.org.uk/\">online shop</a> and the matching pencil case is available at <a href=\"http://shop.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF</a>.  Buying the set benefits the two charities as well as the women's co-op.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Rechargeable batteries (available through Maplin's <a href=\"http://www.maplin.co.uk/\">online shop</a>) are much more eco-friendly than conventional batteries as they last much longer, reducing the amount thrown away. If paired with a solar re-charger (also available from Maplin), rechargeable batteries simultaneously save money, conserve energy and cut down on waste. When they do finally run out, rechargeable batteries, like conventional ones, should always be taken to a recycling centre, as improperly disposed of they release heavy metals such as cadmium and lithium that harm both the environment and public health. </p><p><strong>5. </strong>This stylish study bag and pencil case set is made of recycled rice sacks by, in Amnesty International's words, \"a project in Cambodia which works to meet the needs of destitute women and children living on the streets of Phnom Penh.\" Purchases benefit both Amnesty and the Cambodian project.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>The virgin timber-based pulp and paper industry is the third greatest emitter of global warming pollution in the industrialised world, with carbon dioxide emissions expected to double by 2020.  To cut down on paper consumption for homework, use both sides of a piece of paper whenever possible, and remember to recycle the paper when finished with it.  Aim for at least 30% post-consumer waste content in all paper purchases (this refers to how much of the \"recycled\" paper is actually made out of recycled paper). The most environmentally friendly papers are those that are 100% post-consumer waste and those that do not use chlorine in the production process - bleaching with ozone or hydrogen peroxide is preferable.  <a href=\"http://www.ryman.co.uk/\">Ryman</a> sells a Xerox-brand recycled, chlorine-free paper called Recycled Supreme.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>WWF sells a number of sustainable wood and paper products, such as coloured pencils made from Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood and stylish notebooks made entirely from recycled materials.  Particularly handy for jotting down assignments is a Picture Pocket Diary with pages made of 100% post-consumer waste paper.    </p><p><strong>8. </strong>Marks and Spencer is currently donating 5% of its school uniform sales to Save the Children, and some of its shirts are made from Fairtrade-certified cotton. But an even greener option for kitting yourself out for school this year is to get a secondhand uniform. Kids grow so quickly that uniforms often only fit for one year. Friends with older children and secondhand shops are good places to start, but you may also find uniforms on <a href=\"http://www.ebay.co.uk/\">eBay</a> or at <a href=\"http://uk.freecycle.org/\">Freecycle</a> (an \"I'm done with it, would you like it?\" rubbish-reducing website). <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/\">Oxfam</a> is rolling out a school uniform recycling program this year, but for now it is limited to Clarkston, in Scotland. Many schools hold secondhand uniform sales; if your school does not, consider organising one.  It's a great way to help the environment, save parents money and raise funds for the school. Out of school, it's quite fashionable to be green these days. For example, American company <a href=\"http://www.patagonia.com\">Patagonia</a> has long been noteworthy for its high-quality garments made out of recycled plastics; childrens' options include jackets and trousers.  It now sells stylish T-shirts to benefit Oceana, an environmental group dedicated to preserving and restoring the world's oceans. <a href=\"http://www.adili.com/\">Adili</a> also offers a wide variety of ethical clothing for children and adults.</p><p><strong>9. </strong>If you take a packed lunch to school, single-use plastic water and juice bottles generate a lot of waste, and even when recycled still require energy to process (with the associated carbon footprint).  A better option is purchasing and filling a reusable water bottle instead. Swiss company Sigg has a kids' line of brightly coloured aluminium bottles, while American company Nalgene offers a number of high-quality plastic bottles for all ages.  Sigg and Nalgene bottles can be found at any number of stockists - major online retailers include <a href=\"http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.co.uk\">cotswoldoutdoor.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.giltsharp.co.uk\">giltsharp.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.actionoutdoors.co.uk/\">actionoutdoors.co.uk</a>.  If you are in North America, consider purchasing a bottle through Nalgene's Filter for Good programme, as Brita and Nalgene will donate some of the proceeds toward providing clean water in the developing world.</p><p><strong>10. </strong>If you're trying to decide whether to buy a computer now, or to wait, it is worth knowing that many computer companies plan to phase out some nasty chemicals (polyvinyl chloride and brominated flame retardants) from their products in the very near future. Apple is aiming for the end of 2008, while Dell, Lenovo and Acer are aiming for 2009. If you can wait a year or two, it might be well worth the delay. If you can't wait that long, keep an eye out for energy-efficient computers marked either with an Energy Star logo or the TCO label (from a Swedish organisation that issues environmental and quality labels for computers, screens and keyboards).  Another way to reduce energy use is to turn off the computer (and monitor) when you aren't using it. When you are tired of an old machine, consider donating it to a school or giving it to a friend. If you must dispose of yours, make sure you take it to an accredited recycling centre or refurbishing company rather than just tossing it into landfill.</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>Matt Gribble is studying biology and environmental economics at Stanford University, California</p><p><strong>&#183; </strong>You Can Save the Planet by Richard Hough has more ideas and tips about ethical living.
